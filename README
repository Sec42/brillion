This is intended to be a faithful reimplementation of an old C=64 game called crillion.

This game is quite finished. Some parts of the game could do with better error handling, but it runs very well.

A few things are still missing:

*   More levels
*   Documentation
*   Usable wrapper around save/load solutions
*   Port for MacOS
*   Binary packages for your favourite OS 

If you can help with any of that, Feel free to contact me.
