+ Add better(complete) sound FX
+ Add mini-animation engine
  (moving: ball, disk; stationary: stone_explosion, ball_explosion, death_anim)
+ Add music (ingame, title, credits) (cecile?)
+ Add better stone models (rotfl?)
  + Round ball: use either png:transparent or
    color keying instead of current method.
+ Add better bg graphic
+ Add layout description file & parser.
+ Add score
+ Add level switching
+ Add title screen, credits
+ Add game rules description (perhaps in-game?)
+ Fix corner-case in physics.c (Two-stars hit at the same time)

+ How to print level names? Use BFont? Use monospaced? Use COLOR_KEYING?
+ Decide: color stones in-program or externally?
+ In printing routine, maybe add caching?
  How to decide when to use alpha? ot is probably to slow to do that everywhere.
+ Is it actually okay to use DBLBUF? or better single, and update_Rect?
  if really necessary, updated could be combined off-screen and copied.
+ Should all graphic/sound things be changeable by level, or by 'Collection'?
+ Should the gamefield be completely static? Or e.g. the borders be
  pieces itself?
+ should sound effects be all played, or cut themselfs off like in the
  original
