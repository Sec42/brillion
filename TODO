+ Add better(complete) sound FX
+ Add mini-animation engine
  (moving: ball, disk; stationary: stone_explosion, ball_explosion, "twinkle")
+ Add music (ingame, title, credits) (cecile?)
+ Add better stone models (rotfl?)
  + Round ball: use either png:transparent or
    color keying instead of current method.
+ Add better bg graphic
+ Add layout description file & parser.
  (should now be in 'Settings' file)
+ Add title screen, credits
+ Add game rules description (perhaps in-game?)

? How to print level names? Use BFont? Use monospaced? Use COLOR_KEYING?
? color stones in-program or externally?
  (currently in-program, but may get complicated with shaded stones)
? In printing routine, maybe add caching?
  How to decide when to use alpha? it is probably to slow to do that everywhere.
. Is it actually okay to use DBLBUF? or better single, and update_Rect?
  if really necessary, updated could be combined off-screen and copied.
  (heroes uses DBLBUF and is amazingly fast. So this seems OK)
. Should all graphic/sound things be changeable by level, or by 'Collection'?
  (by Collection, for now)
. Should the gamefield be completely static? Or e.g. the borders be
  pieces itself?
  (completely static, for now)
? should sound effects be all played, or cut themselfs off like in the
  original

? heroes is quite fast but yet doesn't use ANYFORMAT, but palette instead.
  perhaps their way of managing the screen themselves and just telling SDL 
  to update the entire screen at once is a performance gain?

bug: If you keep an arrow key pressed during a level change/restart that
     direction gets cleared.
bug: hit two "stars" or "disks" at the same time (in a corner). In the original
     only one disk moves. (not 100% sure about stars)
diff: original game contains different 'Wall' blocks. No difference in
      gameplay, just for visual effect.

? timing on linux seems off. The game feels too fast.
