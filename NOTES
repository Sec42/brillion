Since SDL_Delay has a granularity of ~10msec and a minimum wait time
of ~20msec (both due to scheduler granularity) we have to do
a lot of busy-waiting to fix that.
If your OS does better than that (both FreeBSD and Linux can
fix this by recompiling the kernel), you can change the
#defines SLEEP_MIN and SLEEP_GRAN in brillion.h to lessen
the load on your machine.
