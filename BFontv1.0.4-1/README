Example:

    1. Type "make"
    2. Type "Test <font1.png> <font2.png>"

Usage:
    1. Load font information with LoadFont() function. See the 'Test'
       example for details.

    2. Now you can use the font in you SDL program.
       Please, take a look at BFont.h to get info about the funtions.

Documentation:
    1. Full documentation at:
          http://www.cs.unibo.it/~dbilli/bfont/manual/BFontManual.html

FileFormat:
    The font image file is the same used by SFont and DFont.

    This mini-help is copied by "SFont README":

    The font file can be any type image file supported by SDL_image
    library.
    The characters start with ASCII symbol #33. They are seperated by
    pink(255,0,255) lines at the top of the image. The space between
    these lines is the width of the caracter. Just take a look at the
    font, and you'll be able to understand what I tried to explain here.
    The easiest way to create a new font is to use the GIMP's Logo
    function. Use the following string as text (ASCII 33-127 with
    escape sequences and spaces between the letters):

    ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \\ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
